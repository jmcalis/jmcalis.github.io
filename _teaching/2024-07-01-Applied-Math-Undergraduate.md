I was lucky enough to get ot mentor a very talented undergrad from UPenn through a research project about classifying limits of solutions to a model arising form the Theory of planned behavior.

Classification of Equilibrium States in a Model of Planned Behavior
======
Based off of a model for collective action arsing from the theory of planned behavior from Fefferman et al., My mentee and colaboratore Rishi Dadlani was able to classify all of the equilibrium states for a system of two players who each may act and incite their coplayer to act. We even extended this to include the case when each player has a two potential actions which may be considered opposite.
