abstract = {In group foraging animals, vigilance tends to decrease as group size increases. A forager in a group receives a vigilance benefit not only when it is being vigilant itself but also when a group mate is being vigilant. The many eyes hypothesis supposes that individuals exhibit lower vigilance in larger groups because of this. However, changes in safety resulting from the vigilance benefit conferred by group mates can change the decision to join or leave a group so as vigilance changes because of changes in group size, group size may also change in response to changes in vigilance. Additionally, individuals may have poor information about the vigilance strategies of their neighbors. We present a game theoretical model of vigilance that incorporates dynamic group sizes and does not require behavioral monitoring of the vigilance strategies of others. For systems at equilibrium, maximum vigilance decreases with increased group size. Furthermore, by varying intraspecific competition we show an inverse relationship between group size and vigilance. Thus, we provide a mechanism in support of the many eyes hypothesis from an evolutionary game theory perspective and conclude that variation in intraspecific competition and its effect on group size may be responsible for the relationship.}

The system is simplified compared to many natural settings, and to some extent the entire environment can be manipulated, from architectural design to materials use, air flow, human traffic, and capacity to disrupt microbial communities through cleaning. Here, we provide an overview of the ecology of the microbiome in the built environment. We address niche space and refugia, population, and community (metagenomic) dynamics, spatial ecology within a building, including the major microbial transmission mechanisms, as well as evolution. We also address landscape ecology, connecting microbiomes between physically separated buildings. At each stage, we pay particular attention to the actual and potential interface between disciplines, such as ecology, epidemiology, materials science, and human social behavior. We end by identifying some opportunities for future interdisciplinary research on the microbiome of the built environment.},

abstract = {Given a connected graph G, Kemeny’s constant K(G) measures the average travel time for a random walk to reach a randomly selected vertex. It is known that when an edge is added to G, the value of Kemeny’s constant may either decrease, increase, or stay the same. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of this behaviour when the initial graph is a tree with n vertices. We prove that when an edge is added into a tree on n vertices, the maximum possible increase in Kemeny’s constant is roughly 23n, while the maximum possible decrease is roughly 316n2. We also identify the trees, and the edges to be added, that correspond to the maximum increase and maximum decrease. Throughout, both matrix theoretic and graph theoretic techniques are employed.}
